E3Experiments
=============
This extension contains the code for the Editor Engagement Experiments (E3)
team's timestamp experiment. It does not properly belong in the Git repository
of the LastModified extension (which is one of its dependencies), but was
placed here temporarily as a means of working around a delay in repository
creation on Gerrit. It will be trimmed from the repository once the experiment
has concluded.

The functionality of the LastModified extension has not been impacted, and you
may continue loading it as before. The E3Experiments sub-extension will not be
loaded unless you load it explicitly.
